# What is BMIsLAB?
The Brain-Machine Interface Systems Lab (BMIsLAB) is a team of researchers led by José María Azorín. Our work focuses on human-machine interaction through brain control in order to improve human capabilities in neural rehabilitation.
This repository is an open source signal processing environment for electrospinography (ESG) signals running on Matlab. This folder contains original Matlab functions from the BMISLAB that have been adapted to the context of the project ReGAIT.

 
# Available Toolboxes
1. Signal Processing and Validation Toolbox

Designed for preprocessing and technical validation of ESG signals.
📂 See: [Signal_Processing_Validation](./Signal_Processing_Validation/)


2. ECG Denoising and Statistical Analysis Toolbox

Focused on ECG artifact removal and statistical evaluation of denoising algorithms.
📂 See: [ECG_Denoising_Statistics](./ECG_Denoising_Statistics/)

# Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or newer
- Petersen's ECG Artifact Removal Toolbox (see [repository link](https://github.com/ime-luebeck/ecg-removal/releases/tag/1.1))
